## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Interview_Performance_Prediction
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Interview_performance_prediction.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

3. To run the prediction script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
