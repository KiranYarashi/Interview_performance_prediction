# Interview Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict interview performance using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- **dataset.txt**: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml**: XML file for face detection using Haar cascades.
- **Interview_performance_prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model training.
- **m.py**: Contains utility functions and helper methods.
- **main.py**: Main script to run the prediction model.
- **model.h5**: Trained model file.
- **readme.md**: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Interview_Performance_Prediction
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Interview_performance_prediction.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

3. To run the prediction script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
